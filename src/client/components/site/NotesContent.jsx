      So let me read them for you! I try to take notes while consuming long-form content. Otherwise
      I find it difficult to stay engaged and will begin taking the author at their word on
      everything. But people are fallible and it can be educational to be defensive, particularly
      when you know you want to believe the argument. So my notes are frequently snarky or
      half-complete, or exist purely to jot my memory. But maybe you too will get value from them.
