      Writing forces you to get messy with ideas, knead them around in your head for a while. This
      is my place for such thoughts. These could be of anything, may be more personal (either "hits
      close to home" or "may have a limited audience"), and may contain more varied media (for
      instance, I plan on posting about some of my travels here).
