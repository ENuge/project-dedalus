    <h1>219 Times Different: Ethiopia and Monaco, Back to Back</h1>
    <p>
      Caveat: I wrote this mostly for my parents, who've never had the opportunities
      to travel that I've had.

      Ethiopia
      {"'"}s nominal GDP per capita, according to the World Bank, was $768 in 2017. [0] Monaco
      {"'"}s per-capita GDP in the same year was $444...per day. [1] On average, in less than two
      days, the mean Monacan
      {"'"}s contribution to their country
      {"'"}s total productive output eclipses the output of the mean Ethiopian
      {"'"}s over an entire year. These numbers are the basis of the {'"'}
      219 times different
      {'"'} mentioned in the title.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat thankfully, those numbers don
      {"'"}t really tell you much of anything. I don
      {"'"}t have better numbers to share in their stead, but I do have photos!
    </p>
    <p>
      So, here
      {"'"}s my still-forming impression of the two countries, an extremely reductive, simplistic
      cracked-lookingglass-from-a-distance view of over 100 million people.

    <p>
      We
      {"'"}
      ll start where I landed—Meskel Square, the first stop on my first day in Addis Ababa,
      Ethiopia
      {"'"}s capital. Addis is growing. I can point you again at GDP—Ethiopia
      {"'"}s GDP growth in the past decade has been hovering around 10% per year. Humans are really
      bad at understanding compounding growth—but basically, imagine a curve that grows really
      steeply. That doubles just after 7 years (and continues growing even quicker relative to that
      first point in time!). That
      {"'"}s Ethiopia by the numbers[2], and it
      {"'"}s extremely visible in the cities.

    />
    <p>
      Walking through Addis is like walking through a time-lapse photo, just without the stylized
      red streaks of taillights. There are very few old buildings, but very many unfinished ones -
      but <em>not</em> unfinished as in abandoned. Any one of those buildings with loose cinder blocks or
      exposed steel beams poking through poured concrete may grow another floor, or a roof, at any
      point. The only constant in Addis is change—the city ten years from now will be completely
      different from the one I just visited.
    </p>
    <ExpandableImage alt="Ethiopian coffee" src="https://storage.cloud.google.com/dedalus-assets/img/ethiopia_coffee.jpeg" />
    <p>
      Well, change and coffee, I suppose. Around 15% of the country
      {"'"}s people derive their livelihoods from coffee. The rest just derive their well-being and
      alertness. I was invited to a traditional coffee ceremony in Lalibela, a fairly small village
      in northern Ethiopia, best-known for being the site of the rock-hewn Lalibela churches. The
      three rounds of progressively-darker-roasted beans I had there, a thick but rather tasty brew,
      made up just one of the three such ceremonies Dennis said they have there every day. So 9
      strong cups of coffee a day—and I thought my 2-3 a day was bad!

    <p>
      I{"'"}m getting tired of narrating, so I{"'"}m going to turn this over more to the photo side
      of a photo {'"'}
      essay
      {'"'} (which makes it feel like homework. I know, I try.). But a few other words: the people
      of Ethiopia are incredibly friendly, and inspirationally industrious—probably out of need.
      But all the same, the raw creative spirit, the ability to go out and try without having a
      guide or top-down authority, largely doesn
      {"'"}t exist in the highly-educated, stratified Western world. There are obvious benefits to
      the likes of OSHA, but seeing others get by because they need to without the guard rails we
      take for granted makes me think a bit about the power structures I rode to get where I am—at
      a place where I can afford to observe all this. You can see what would be considered western
      enterpreneurialism in Addis
      {"'"}s Merkato, the world
      {"'"}s largest outdoor market—which employs an estimated 13,000 people in 7,100 business
      entities. People sell everything, carry everything, make everything, here. There is so
      much...everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      I{"'"}
      ll leave the scenery to be explained better by the pictures, but I guess I can explain the
      physical phenomenon...as best as I am capable, which sadly is not that well. The
      red-green-white-orange-
      {'<'}
      insert-beautiful-color-here
      {'>'} salt flats are different minerals being oxidized. From copper-to-rust giving the
      characteristic red we

      re all familiar with, to sulphur
      {"'"}s green (we
      {"'"}d be more used to its smell...which approximates a bad egg times 100).

      The Mad Max-style rock mountains were formed by surface ruptures thousands (millions? a really
      long time?) of years ago, back when all of this was part of the sea. They
      {"'"}
      re dry and craggy but super fun to climb! The flats show the remainder of that sea: a very
      thin salt lake. You can walk all the way out into it and there
      {"'"}s barely any water. The locals here, the Afar tribe, make their living by mining this
      salt. Literally the entire ground is just hard rocksalt, that they break up into blocks with
      pickaxes, load onto their camels, and then walk off, day-after-day, selling where they can. It
      {"'"}s hard, subsistence living. Did I mention this is also the hottest, and one of the
      lowest, places on the planet? Respect your creature comforts, it
      {"'"}s pure chance that you
      {"'"}
      re reading this on a computer and not out there picking at salt just to exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that said, technology is making huge inroads into Ethiopian culture. Most people in
      cities have cell phones. Working at a mobile payments/financial technology company, I was
      really interested in the effect tech was having on their day-to-day business lives. Most of
      the problems they were facing either have not been solved in a comprehensive way in the modern
      world, or require exactly the sort of solution that was extremely non-trivial even in the US
      just five years ago. Which is to say, many of the problems here are tractable, the physical
      infrastructure (wiring, etc) is mostly good enough, where applying very modern solutions can
      lead to huge leaps in welfare and productivity. Some of the feature requests I was hearing from
      individuals were pretty damn similar to what you might hear from startups in the US or Europe.
      When distribution is cheap, the impact potential is huge—especially if the government
      consciously fosters multiplicative effects like education and entrepreneurship.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be clear, that won
      {"'"}t solve all of Ethiopia
      {"'"}s issues. Smaller villages frequently don
      {"'"}t have roofs. People poop wherever they can find some cover (when you see the state of
      any fixed bathroom they might have, you
      {"'"}d understand and find yourself doing the same). Water is frequently the largest expense -
      the only drinkable water is bottled, and it
      {"'"}s not cheap. UN foreign aid is a lifeblood to some of these villages. China
      {"'"}s Belt & Road Initiative has helped to a significant degree—it
      {"'"}s visible to the point where I was confused for being a {'"'}
      China man
      {'"'}—but teaching people to fish (read: build infrastructure) is of limited use when there
      {"'"}s no water (literally no water and very little arable land).
    </p>
    <p>
      I can
      {"'"}t understate the level of energy and dynamism in Ethiopia. So much is happening. And
      there
      {"'"}s a mountain of opportunity for that to continue. That will rely on continued government
      stability, and a not-insignificant degree of ingenuity in solving some of the hard problems,
      ones that will only get harder as the world gets hotter. Frankly I don
      {"'"}t know enough about Ethiopian government economic policy to comment further, but that
      {"'"}s my understanding of the state of things.

    <h1>And now, over to you, Monaco. </h1>

    <p>
      Monaco is absolutely stunning, I{"'"}
      ll admit that. But one of my main takeaways from leaving the city was that there
      {"'"}s nothing significantly better about their way of life than my own—or to compare to a
      more similar environment, life on the rest of the côte d{"'"}
      azur. Nice, for instance, is a cheaper place to live than anywhere I{"'"}
      ve lived. (Which almost certainly says more about myself than anything.) Presumably take-home income is
      adjusted for that and I don
      {"'"}t feel like looking at the numbers, but let
      {"'"}s assume it
      {"'"}s roughly a wash.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, basically, what the wealthy get for their wealth, over your typical developed country,
      appeared to me to be mostly status symbols. Maybe they keep all the super-cool secret stuff
      indoors. To be very clear, I say all of this from a position of privilege—I work as a software engineer,
      and software as an industry has been great for me. There are many people in developed countries struggling
      to get by. This might be more accurately comparing the top quartile of a standard developed country with
      the top 10% in Monaco, which may not even represent that large of an income disparity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when I look at the official landing page for the Mercedes-Maybach, which starts at just
      shy of $200,000, I literally do not see a single feature mentioned that
      {"'"}s not available in any other modern car. The page actually does not mention a single
      utilitarian feature, at all. It does repeat over and over again the exclusivity and
      {' "'}
      individuality
      {'"'} of the car. I was under the impression luxury purchases were supposed to imply that,
      mostly via their cost, but I guess it
      {"'"}s breached the walls and they now just tell you how exclusive you
      {"'"}
      ve become up front.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be clear, not everyone in Monaco rolls around in Ferraris all day, and I{"'"}m under the
      impression they have quite generous social services (frankly I{"'"}d be horrified if they didn
      {"'"}
      t, given the clear wealth also on display here). But while the port is nice, the buildings
      incredible, the gardens edenic, it
      {"'"}s still just another place.

    <p>
      I suppose the main takeaway here is something along the lines of: {'"'}
      Think you
      {"'"}
      re escaping and run into yourself.
      {'"'} People are the same everywhere. How they live, act, and what they value is heavily,
      heavily influenced by society and the environment. Combining the two trips focuses a strong
      light on the middle, where I find myself. Should the experiences on these trips, or reflecting
      on this now, change my perception of self? Probably not all that much—it would be a fickle
      25 year old to have life determined by a chance two weeks—but in the never-ending decision
      tree that is life, it is important to recognize that the roots as well as the branches could
      have all been different.
