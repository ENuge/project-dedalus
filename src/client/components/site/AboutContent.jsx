    <h1>I'm Eoin Nugent</h1>
    <p>
      I make things on the Internet. Mostly bad puns and obscure references, but occasionally some
      code too.{' '}
    </p>
    <p>
      I made this site as a sort of empty vessel begging to be filled. There's an incredibly low
      barrier to accessing an amazing amount of knowledge on the Internet…but it's easy to gorge
      yourself on the Internet equivalent of fast food. I'm hoping that producing more of my own
      content will force me to be deliberate in what I consume.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that in mind: any recommendations on follow-ups or alternative perspectives to anything I
      mention would be greatly appreciated!
    </p>
    <h1>Work</h1>
    <p>
      I work at Stripe, in Dublin. We're building the economic infrastructure for the Internet.
      Within Stripe I work on local payment methods in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. I've also
      worked on developer platform (think: the APIs, docs, and surrounding ecosystem) and developer
      tooling (in particular, test infrastructure). If any of that interests you, please do reach out!
    </p>
    <h1>Personal</h1>
    <p>
      I enjoy reading, listening to audiobooks, cycling (…frequently while listening to an
      audiobook), lifting, traveling, cooking, talking about big ideas, writing (mainly as a form of
      reflection), laughing, and the Oxford comma. Nothing too unusual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lately I've been particularly interested in modern world history and economic trends at a very
      broad level. The likes of Martin Meredith's histories of Africa, except applied to all the
      areas my Western education kinda forgot to mention. My day-job work has moved down-stack quite
      a bit, so I'm excited to dig into a little syllabus I've created for myself that tackles
      systems-level and devops infrastructure more directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you made it past all the virtue signaling, mad props to you. I also listen to a lot of
      JAY-Z, Kanye, and any sort of pump-me-up hip hop. I highly value not taking myself too
      seriously (I swear!) and love sarcasm and jokes, particularly self-referential in-jokes. My
      only hope is that those jokes may some day take on a strange loop type sentience.
    </p>
    <h1>Contact</h1>
    <p>
      Email is your best bet. Over time I've developed a strong aversion to the dopamine drip of
      social networks, so I've configured them all somewhat-cavalierly to <em>maybe</em> email me if
      someone directly reaches out via those channels.
