    <h1>I'm Eoin Nugent</h1>

      I make things on the Internet. Mostly bad puns and obscure references, but occasionally some
      code too.{' '}
    </p>
    <p>
      I made this site as a sort of empty vessel that I hope will tug on my sleeves to be filled.
      There's an incredibly low barrier to accessing an amazing amount of knowledge on the Internet.
      Many companies vie for my, or your, limited attention. Separately I've been working on how I
      alot my attention to which types of knowledge, but here I hope to tilt my focus from
      consumption to production…with it becoming a signalful input into what I consume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any recommendations on follow-ups or alternative perspectives to anything I mention would be
      greatly appreciated!

    <h1>Work</h1>
    <p>
      I work at Stripe, in Dublin. We're building the economic infrastructure for the Internet.
      Within Stripe I build testing infrastructure so other engineers can be more productive. Think:
      Jenkins, but also performance optimization, high-leverage UI/UX flows, and some nice fuzzy
      questions like "when should we run a test and what does its result even <em>mean</em>
      ". If any of this interests you, please do reach out—my contact info is at the end of the
      page.

      I've bounced around the stack a fair bit. While at Stripe in San Francisco I sharpened my
      frontend teeth helping to redesign the API Reference Docs, especially the new search
      component. Prior to Stripe I worked at Yelp—first, making internationalization tooling faster,
      more robust, and more useful; then, rapidly experimenting in localizing the product to
      particular markets; and finally, improving the experience for new Yelp users.

    <h1>Personal</h1>
    <p>
      I enjoy reading, listening to audiobooks, cycling (…frequently while listening to an audiobook
      or podcast), lifting, traveling, cooking, talking about big ideas, writing (mainly as a form
      of reflection), laughing, and the Oxford comma. Nothing too unusual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lately I've been particularly interested in modern world history and economic trends at a very
      broad level. The likes of The Fortunes of Africa and The Fate of Africa by Martin Meredith,
      except applied to all the areas my Western education kinda forgot to mention. My day-job work
      has moved down-stack quite a bit, so I'm excited to dig into a little syllabus I've created
      for myself that tackles systems-level and devops infrastructure more directly.

      In previous states of mind: Joyce/Beckett-esque Modernism and its profound dis/respect for
      social constructions (especially language) caught my fancy; I had a go at learning French for
      a bit that I want to return to Some Day™; and I poked a bit at each subject I chose,
      deliberately or not, to not major in at college—I don't think I retained much from that.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you made it past all the virtue signaling, mad props to you. I also listen to a lot of
      JAY-Z, Kanye, and any sort of pump-me-up hip hop. I highly value not taking myself too
      seriously (I swear!) and love sarcasm and jokes, particularly self-referential in-jokes. My
      only hope is that those jokes may some day take on a strange loop type sentience.

    <h1>Contact</h1>
    <p>
      Email is your best bet. Over time I've developed a strong aversion to the dopamine drip of
      social networks, so I've configured them all somewhat-cavalierly to <em>maybe</em> email me if
      someone directly reaches out via those channels.
