    <h1>I'm Eoin Nugent</h1>
    <p>
      I make things on the Internet. Mostly bad puns and obscure references, but occasionally some
      code too.{' '}
    </p>
    <p>
      I reserve the right to use this site to write about whatever interests me in the moment. Or to
      not write at all. We shall see!
    </p>
    <h1>Work</h1>
    <p>
      I work at Stripe, in Dublin. We're building the economic infrastructure for the Internet.
      Within Stripe I work on local payment methods in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. I've also
      worked on our developer platform (think: the APIs, docs, and surrounding ecosystem) and developer
      tooling (in particular, test infrastructure). If any of that interests you, please do reach out!
    </p>
    <h1>Personal</h1>
    <p>
      I enjoy reading, listening to audiobooks, cycling (â€¦frequently while listening to an
      audiobook), lifting, traveling, cooking, writing (mainly as a form of
      reflection), laughing, and the Oxford comma. The usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      I used to have a blurb here about ~academic interests, but I haven't touched any of the things
      I mentioned there in quite a while. Let's say I bounce around a fair bit.
    </p>
    <h1>Contact</h1>
    <p>
      Email is your best bet. Over time I've developed a strong aversion to the dopamine drip of
      social networks, so I've configured them all somewhat-cavalierly to <em>maybe</em> email me if
      someone directly reaches out via those channels.
